                                <p>Thanks to parents for their patience as the Governing Board updated our online payment provider. We are now in the position to accept regular and/or one off donations from parents towards the ABC fund. As you know, there is a squeeze on school budgets and we are asking parents and carers to please contribute towards their children's enriched education at Princess Frederica. We suggest a monthly contribution of £20 per child. Please also see the information below that was shared by governors at the recent forums for parents.

                                <p>What does GDPR mean for schools?A great deal of the processing of personal data undertaken by schools will fall under a specific legal basis, ‘in the public interest’. As it is in the public interest to operate schools successfully, it will mean that specific consent will not be needed in the majority of cases in schools.</p>

                                <p>GDPR will ensure data is protected and will give individuals more control over their data, however this means schools will have greater accountability for the data:</p>


                                <ul>
                                    <li> Under GDPR, consent must be explicitly given to anything that isn’t within the normal business of the school, especially if it involves a third party managing the data. Parents (or the pupil themselves depending on their age) must express consent for their child’s data to be used outside of the normal business of the school.</li>
                                    <li>Schools must appoint a Data Protection Officer and be able to prove that they are GDPR compliant.</li>
                                    <li> Schools must ensure that their third party suppliers who may process any of their data is GDPR compliant and must have legally binding contracts with any company that processes any personal data. These contracts must cover what data is being processed, who it is being processed by, who has access to it and how it is protected.</li>
                                    <li> It will be compulsory that all data breaches which are likely to have a detrimental effect on the data subject are reported to the ICO within 72 hours.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>At Princess Frederica Primary School, we are very keen for children to attend school regularly. It is proven that good attendance is linked to academic success and is important for your child’s mental health and well-being.The following grades are used in the school reports to show your child’s attendance. The government expectation is that children should be in school at least 96% of the time so if attendance falls below this level, a warning letter will be sent and if attendance falls below 90%, an invitation letter will be sent for a meeting with the school attendance officer.

This outlines the legal requirements for parents/carers to ensure that their children attend school. If leave of absence is taken without the request having been agreed, the absence will be recorded as unauthorised.If absence is requested for a medical appointment, proof must be supplied. This can be in the form of an appointment letter, email or text.

                                <p>If parents/carers decide to take their child out of school without permission, a referral can be made to Brent Educational Welfare Service and this could result in an education penalty notice (EPN) being issued. At Princess Frederica we will apply to the Educational Welfare Service for an EPN to be served against parents/carers who regularly take leave before or after a holiday.EPN fines are £120 if paid within 28 days, reduced to £60 if paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine may result in parents being prosecuted in court for their child’s unauthorised absence from school.Furthermore, taking a child out of school without permission could also mean the child’s school place is at risk and parents/carers may have to reapply for a place via Brent Admissions.

                            <p>We expect every child to wear the correct school uniform every day. Please look closely at the information below to ensure that your child is wearing the correct school uniform. During the summer months children are not allowed to wear flip flops or sunglasses. Children should bring into school a sun hat so they can play outside safely. Children should not bring sun cream into school. Boys should only wear grey socks. Girls should only wear white socks or grey tights.All items of school uniform are available from ACE Clothing. Your order can be delivered to school on Tuesdays. Please ask at the school office for a uniform order form if you need one. Forms are also available on our website. Lots of parents kindly donate second hand uniform so sales of 2nd hand uniform are organised by the PSA and held periodically throughout the year. Please ensure that your child does not wear jewellery to school, with the exception of studs or sleepers for children with pierced ears. Parents must ensure that children do not wear sleepers on P.E. days, or if they do, that they can take them out easily at school. The school cannot take responsibility for any jewellery or valuables brought to school.
