                        <p>Princess Frederica is proud to be a popular school but this does mean that we receive more applications than we have places in Reception and are unfortunately not able to offer every child a place at the start of the school year. </p>
                        <p> We encourage parents to join our waiting list as places may become available later on in the year, for example when parents' circumstances change. For the same reason, a limited number of places may also become available in later school years.
                         </p>
                         <p>Applications for such places are referred to as 'in year' applications and should be made direct to the school, in the first instance. If you have an enquiry about 'in year' applications or about your child joining the waiting list for a place at Princess Frederica, please contact the school office by emailing  <a href="mailto:admin@princessfrederica.brent.sch.uk">admin@princessfrederica.brent.sch.uk</a> or by calling 0208 969 7756. The office will be happy to provide you with an application for an 'in year' admission.</p>

                        <p>As of the 2017-18 academic year, we are now running a full-time nursery with provision for 30 children. 15 funded hours are available to all children and parents may pay for additional hours if you are not entitled to a 30 hour government funded place. </p>
                        <p>The nursery day starts at 9:00am and finishes at 12 o'clock (for part-time) and 3:15pm for full-time.</p>
                        <p> If you wish for your child to start nursery at Princess Frederica in September 2024, your child must have turned 3 before 31st August 2024. You must apply directly to the school before 15th January 2024. After this date, please complete an application and submit to the school. This will be considered as a late application and the school will be in contact. </p>
                        <p>We also offer in-year admissions into our nursery if we have places available. Please contact the office for further <br> information.</p>
