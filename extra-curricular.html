                            <p>Residential trips form an important part of the philosophy of the school. We believe that in order for children to have a well rounded education, it is important to experience learning in alternative surroundings that pose varying challenges. Our programme of residential trips means children, from Year 2, start to experience life away from their everyday home environment and develop the skills and emotional resilience necessary to deal successfully with the different social and environmental factors time away in a new area for a sustained amount of time will bring. We are constantly reviewing our provision for residential trips and sometimes change visits depending on the quality of experience.</p>

                            <p>A very big thank you to the PSA who always work tirelessly to produce an incredible line up for our Princess Frederica Book Week. Their work and time investment always ensures that all the children throughout all year groups have a week where they hear from some incredible artists and illustrators.</p>

                            <p>Book week is a focus on everything great about books and reading. It involves all the children in the school in various different activities such as paired reading, book reviews, listening to stories read by different people including our parents and carers and sharing stories we have written ourselves. It's also a week where an author or illustrator visits the school every day to inspire the children to deepen their love of reading.</p>
