                                <p>Our curriculum has been designed to create a love of learning that ensures positive engagement in subjects that build a sequential bank of knowledge and skills that help children access more complex learning as they move through their time at the school. The curriculum uses vehicles such as reading, music, residential visits, project based homework, workshops, dress up days, focus weeks and day trips to create excitement, confidence and engagement in what is being learnt to support in moving knowledge learnt from the short term to the long term memory and support children to know more and remember more.</p>

                                <h4 class="text-light-yellow ct-pt">How has the school curriculum content <br> been decided on?</h4>
                                <p>The school curriculum is developed based on a continual evaluative process. This is based on input from a number of different sources including:</p>
                                <ul class="list-text">
                                    <li>Staff meetings designed to look at how the curriculum reflects the local area, the national agenda, the demands and needs of the school and the make-up of the school and local community.</li>
                                    <li>School leaders and subject leaders making a clear decision on how the curriculum works for reflecting the diverse nature of the school and local area as well as how it appeals and can be accessed by children with SEND.</li>
                                    <li>Feedback from the children through the school council. These thoughts and ideas are based on gaining feedback directly from the classes that school councillors represent.</li>
                                    <li>Annual parental/carer feedback giving their thoughts and opinions on the school curriculum including strengths and areas to work on.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div class="text-item constructed-text">
                                <h4 class="text-light-yellow">How is the curriculum constructed?</h4>
                                <p> Curriculum construction is based on building blocks being in place ensuring children are ready for the next step in their educational journey. This means clear progression from year to year in all subjects. The following outlines its construction.

                                </p>
                                <ul class="list-text">
                                    <li>It is based on the National Curriculum.</li>
                                    <li>It includes clear expected milestones for the end of the year in all subject areas.</li>
                                    <li>Assessment questions within foundation subjects that ensure children are learning knowledge and skills that can be used to answer a question or problem. They can then demonstrate learning they have done in the unit.</li>
                                    <li>It is focused on reading as a golden thread throughout.</li>
                                    <li>It is designed to be accessible for SEND children. It is further adapted through targets highlighted in foundation subjects that are a minimum expectation for SEND children by the end of the year.</li>
                                    <li>It is heavily influenced by music and the positive impact this has on discipline in learning, enjoyment and engagement. It also develops confidence and creates opportunities to learn a specialism to a good standard.</li>
                                    <li>Enrichment and fulfilment through trips, residential outings, performances, writing scripts and attending a wide variety of after school clubs.</li>
                                    <li>It is focused on developing well rounded individuals who care about each other and the environment they live and learn in and are aware of their responsibilities as citizens when they leave.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <h4 class="text-light-yellow pt-low">How the curriculum has been created for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)?</h4>
                            <p>Focus has been put into the school curriculum on the importance of all children being able to successfully access the learning. The use of knowledge organisers ensures that children come into a unit of work with a level of knowledge and understanding that prepares them to be able to engage with skills being taught in class rather than focusing purely on the knowledge. These knowledge organisers are uploaded onto the website before the start of half-term so parents/carers can support with pre-teaching. This includes knowledge organisers for science, geography, history, Art and Design, Design and Technology and RE. The overviews in different subjects also outline minimum expectations for all children and minimum expectations for children with SEND. Teachers assess against these milestones as well as against objectives set from baseline assessment so progress can be accurately measured and new objectives set.

                            <h4 class="text-light-yellow ct-pt">What teaching and learning strategies are used to deliver the school <br>curriculum?</h4>
                            <p>The school's approach to how the curriculum is delivered is driven by a commitment to the following key areas. They are:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="list-text curriculum-list">
                                <li><strong>ASSESSMENT FOR LEARNING:</strong> AFL is a process of children being involved in their assessment of their learning while giving teachers continued opportunities to assess children's understanding. Techniques used include children having partners that change on a regular basis so they experience paired working with many different children, a combination of targeted and random questioning, marking involving peer and self-assessment using success criteria and mixed ability learning. To ensure children are always involved in discussions in partner time, teachers will frequently ask children what their partner has said rather then focusing on their answer. This is one way that AFL encourages the learner to listen to others and engage in the discussion rather then simply relying on their own thoughts and opinions. </li>
                                <li><strong>PHILOSOPHY FOR CHILDREN (Including the 4c's):</strong>  P4C is an approach to learning and teaching which enhances children’s thinking, questioning and communication skills, boosts their self-esteem, and improves their academic attainment. It is taught as a stand alone subject with a specific stimulus that creates enquiries to be investigated but is also used to create other key skills that are then utilised across the curriculum. These skills include children addressing children, children using each other's names, maintaining debate backed up by evidence and listening to the key points of others with the confidence to report back to others. </li>
                                <li><strong>SCHOOL VALUES BASED ON CHRISTIANITY: </strong> Our school values are central to the expectations that the school holds for all stake-holders. It drives the methodology around school decision making throughout the school, both in operational situations and strategic direction. It gives guidance to us all as we strive to both maintain and enhance the experience all children have at the school. GrowthUnityKindnessFaith</li>
                                <li><strong>A GROWTH MINDSET:</strong> This is the belief that you can succeed. The school recognises the importance of all children believing that they can succeed at something even if they have not mastered it yet. Teachers remind children about the importance of not saying 'I can't do it' but rather than 'I can't do it...yet.' </li>
                                <li><strong>A LOVE OF READING: </strong> Children are encouraged to read in a number of different ways. Teachers read regularly to their class and visit the library on a weekly basis. Writing is also based around enjoyment in quality texts. Please follow the link on reading to find out more information. </li>
                                <li><strong>CONCRETE BASED UNDERSTANDING: </strong> Princess Frederica recognises the importance of children learning in a concrete way to ensure that when children apply their understanding in a more abstract way, they are doing so with a secure understanding of their learning. This also increases the chances of knowledge becoming consolidated and stored rather than all learning being new and being reliant on working memory which can only store small amounts of information (holding between three and seven pieces of new information) at a time. </li>
                                <li><strong>AN APPROACH TO HOW CHILDREN LEARN BASED ON COGNITION:</strong> We are aware at Princess Frederica of progression being defined as 'knowing more, remembering more'. School staff use different strategies to support the movement of short-term learning to long-term memory.</li>

                    <p>The overview below outlines the school's approach to reading including its over-arching aims, how it <br> implements strategies to move towards those aims and and what that will look like in children.</p>

                       </div>
                       <p>Reading is an important part of daily life at our school and children are encouraged to read from a young age. Children begin to develop a love of books from entry into Nursery; this is also where we begin our delivery of phonics and children start to be introduced to Monster Phonics: the scheme the school uses to teach systematic synthetic phonics (along with learning phonics through environmental sounds). When children move into Reception, daily synthetic phonics teaching becomes part of the delivered curriculum and Monster Phonics is used on a daily basis. Children take books home that are aligned to the sounds they have learnt at school. This is also linked to the school reading programme which follows children until they reach free reader status. After a phonics input, children are given the opportunity to apply their learning. In Year 2, the transition is made to whole class texts in guided reading. Children are also encouraged to always have a second book they are reading for pleasure, a book they select from the school library or one that a teacher has recommended for them.</p>

                <h4 class="text-light-yellow">Book Banding</h4>
                   <p>All children will move through the banded books scheme we employ at the school. This incorporates Monster Phonics followed by books that are banded into colours. Teachers will assess when children are ready to move to a new coloured book band. The document outlines the expectations of children's reading ability and comprehension when they are reading within a certain band and makes it clear what needs to be seen before a child is moved onto the next stage. Once completed, children will become free readers although teachers will still monitor reading habits including genre choices and content.</p>

                <div class="text-item">
                    <p>Phonics is a way of teaching children how to read and write. It helps children hear, identify and use different sounds that distinguish one word from another in the English language. Written language can be compared to a code, so knowing the sounds of individual letters and how those letters sound when they’re combined will help children decode words as they read. Understanding phonics will also help children know which letters to use when they are writing words.</p>
                    <p> Phonics involves matching the sounds of spoken English with individual letters or groups of letters. For example, the sound k can be spelled as c, k, ck or ch. Teaching children to blend the sounds of letters together helps them decode unfamiliar or unknown words by sounding them out. For example, when a child is taught the sounds for the letters t, p, a and s, they can start to build up the words: “tap”, “taps”, “pat”, “pats” and “sat”.</p>
                    <p>Princess Frederica uses Monster Phonics to support the teaching of phonics. Children start phonics sessions in Nursery learning environmental sounds but only start using the Monster Phonics programme in Reception and through Year 1 and Year 2. Children are assessed in Year 1 on their phonics ability in June in the Phonics Screen. The progress of all children in phonics is monitored on a half-termly basis. Teachers continue to make references to phonics throughout all years including Year 6 as well as targeted support for children where it is needed. </p>
                    <p>Monster Phonics is a fun way to teach Systematic Synthetic Phonics. Its advanced multisensory approach uses 10 Monster characters to create interest and engagement for children. Studies show a 38% increase in spelling accuracy in 5 weeks and a 23-month improvement in reading age over a 5-month period.</p>

                    <p>Schools and early years providers follow a structure of learning, development and care for children from birth to five years old. This is called the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and it enables your child to learn through a range of activities.</p>
                    <p>In our Foundation Stage we have a Nursery with places for 30 children and 2 Reception classes. In the stage we ensure:</p>
                    <ul class="list-text">
                        <li>children learn through play</li>
                        <li>providers work closely with parents</li>
                        <li>you are kept up to date on your child’s progress</li>
                        <li>the welfare, learning and all-round development of children with different backgrounds and levels of ability, including those with special educational needs.</li>
                        <li>Starting school is a very big step for your child and for you. The way your child settles into school is very important and we do our best to help each child come to school happily and enjoy learning here. We think it is important to establish a partnership with our parents/carers so that together we can help each child settle in and do his/her best.</li>

                  <p>Each child receives a Foundation Stage Profile. This profile provides a summary of what your child has achieved at the end of their Reception year in school. In Reception, children are graded in the different of the areas of learning. Where a child is working at the expected level this means that they have achieved the standard set out in an Early Learning Goal. In some areas children’s skills may be emergent as a child may still be working towards an Early Learning Goal. Some children will have exceeded the standard expected at the end of the Foundation Stage in some areas. Exceeding a goal indicates that their achievement is well above average. This information will be indicated in your child's end of year report. There will also be updates during meetings with teachers.</p>
                  <p class="fw-bold">Reception Baseline Assessment</p>
                  <p>This is an assessment that is carried out by the child’s class teacher within 6 weeks of the child starting Reception. The school and parents/carers do not find out the results of the assessment but is used to determine the progress a child makes when they complete their Year 6 SATs assessments.</p>
                  
                  <p class="fw-bold">Early Learning Goals</p>
                  <p>At the end of Reception, children are assessed against a set of Early Learning Goals to see if they are developing in line with age related expectations. This assessment is an informal process. The outcome of the assessment will be shared with parents and used by your child's Year 1 teacher to tailor learning to your child's strengths and areas for development.</p>
                  
                  <p class="fw-bold">ABC Fund</p>
                  <p>Our voluntary aided status means that we pay a contribution to the London Diocesan Board for Schools as they are responsible for the maintenance of the school. We ask parents/carers for a contribution to the fund each year to improve the school. It also helps to fund extra-curricular opportunities for the children that would be possible through the school budget. The set amount for 2019-20 is £20 per child per month. </p>

                <h4 class="text-light-yellow">FAQ’s</h4>
               <p class="fw-bold">When should children start learning music?</p>
              <p>Music education can start before children are born, as they can listen to music from within the womb. At school, children are given free whole class music lessons from when they start at school. For paid, individual lessons, children as young as 3 years old can thrive in music lessons, provided that they have an appropriately trained teacher, and a supportive home environment. At school, we currently only offer group lessons to children from year 2 upwards. We suggest that younger children learn outside of school if time and finances allow. Brass and woodwind lessons are not recommended for children before they lose their milk teeth (roughly at 8 years of age). </p>
              <p class="fw-bold">What about other curriculum subjects? Will my child be negatively effected if they are taken out of other lessons in order to take music lessons? </p>
              <p>Our current policy dictates that children can only start 1 instrument during school hours. Therefore, they will miss only 30 minutes of another subject per week. Where possible, we try to rotate lessons around on a half-termly basis, so they don't always miss the same subject. Furthermore, if class teachers notice that a child is falling behind in a particular subject, we endeavour to ensure that the child does not miss those lessons. 
                  Also, in many ways music can be highly beneficial to the cognitive development of children. The fine motor skills, discipline, team work, auditory skills and focus that are developed within music lessons can be transferred to other subjects. Much research has been done in this area. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00074/full"> https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00074/full</a></p>
              
          <p>Hyde (2009) showed that the "children in the music group had structural changes in their frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital brain areas. Moreover, they also showed that these changes correlated significantly with improvements in auditory and motor tasks." 
          </p>
          <p>
              Morenzo (2011) found that "music intervention improved the verbal abilities of the children and that this was paralleled with the facilitation of the neural indices of executive functions."</p>
              <p>Putkinen (2013), suggests that "music activities may help children focus their attention on a given task and inhibit distractors."</p>
              <p>Kirschner and Tomasello (2010) found that "Music activities have been also shown to affect children's behavior. Even short sessions of joint singing and playing musical instruments seem to make children behave in a prosocial manner and increase their social skills."</p>
              <p>
                  Palubinski (2019) found that "While reading assessment scores increased for the entire population, there was a greater increase among ELL students that were enrolled in a music education course."</p>

                    <h4 class="text-light-yellow">Reading</h4>
                    <p>One of the best ways to support your child with their learning is to read with them on a daily basis. Here are some tips on doing this effectively:</p>
                    <ul class="list-text">
                     <li>Try and get into a routine where it is something your child knows is something that happens on a daily basis.</li>
                     <li>Make it a positive and enjoyable experience. Something your child looks forward to. Maybe reading time is associated with having a biscuit or snuggling up somewhere cosy.</li>
                     <li>Where possible, share the experience with your child. It is important your child is reading their book out loud, especially when your child is younger (although you are never too old to read a book to somebody else!).</li>
                     <li>There might also be times where you read to your child and they follow or they read silently. It is fine to use different models. Some children read to their younger siblings or even to a pet.</li>
                     <li>Create a reading culture in your home. if you are asking your child to read while others are watching television or playing computer games, your child's ability to engage in reading diminishes.</li>
                     <li>Ask your child questions about what they are reading. This supports your child's understanding of texts they are reading and ensures their fluency in reading is matched by their understanding.</li>
                     <li>Talk about vocabulary encountered in what your child is reading. Discussing their understanding of new words helps them to develop their own vocabulary and builds confidence in all areas of their learning.</li>
                     <li>Make sure that your child's reading record is being updated on a daily basis. Parents/carers are encouraged to write in these but when old enough, children can manage these themselves. The important thing is that your child is reading as often as possible.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p class="fw-bold">Reading is the gateway to your child successfully accessing the whole school curriculum</p>

                    <p>There are a number of different ways to support your child at home. The objectives listed below show what teachers use to support judgements they are making and key elements they are teaching within the year group they teach in. You might find it useful to look at these objectives to see the expectation is for a child working within a given year group. You may choose to look at an objective and support your child at home by working on it together.

These are always published before the holidays before they are due to be taught. This means parents and carers can support their child's learning by pre-teaching material they will be covering. Your child will then be a much more confident space to excel in this particular subject area when they return to school.
