                                <p>As Headteacher it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Princess Frederica Church
                                    of England Primary School. Our school is a two-form entry from Reception to Year 6
                                    with one Nursery class. We are extremely proud of our school and believe that we
                                    offer a warm, welcoming and inclusive environment rooted in our school values and
                                    Christian ethos. The teachers are committed to encouraging our pupils to have high
                                    expectations academically, spiritually and socially. Princess Frederica offers an
                                    enriched, well structured curriculum which engages children throughout their time at
                                    the school leading to a love of learning preparing them for the challenges and
                                    opportunities the next phase of their education will bring. We strive to create
                                    meaningful, memorable experiences that not only develop the whole child but also
                                    create strong links with the school curriculum and our intent for what we want
                                    children to know and remember.</p>
                                <p>We value the strong partnership with our local community and encourage parents and
                                    carers to play an active part in their child’s education. We have a committed Parent
                                    Staff Association who support in the school’s development goals as well as a
                                    committed Governing Board who both hold the school to account and provide support
                                    and challenge in setting and monitoring the strategic direction of the school.
                                    ​</p>

                                    Princess Frederica is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of
                                    children and young people and expects all staff and volunteers to share this
                                    commitment.</p>
                                <p>Please take some time to browse our school website. There are some useful links below
                                    to help you navigate it. The curriculum page is especially useful in gaining an idea
                                    on what the school’s curriculum approach is (both in how we deliver the curriculum
                                    and the content). I would also like to draw your attention to the ‘Supporting You to
                                    Support Your Child’ page which has been designed to give parents and cares advice in
                                    a number of different areas on how best to support your child (created from feedback
                                    to parents and careers). Finally, please use the link to knowledge organisers. These
                                    are posted at the end of each half-term before the children start to study the given
                                    unit. It is a great opportunity to support your child with being ready to access the
                                    learning really effectively when they start a new half-term.</p>

                            <div class="text-item">
                                <p>Princess Frederica of Hanover (1848- 1926) was the daughter of George and Marie,
                                    King and Queen of Hanover and Duke and Duchess of Cumberland. George was a first
                                    cousin of Queen Victoria. In 1866 he lost his kingdom and went into exile with his
                                    family. After George’s death in 1878, Frederica wished to marry her father’s former
                                    Private Secretary, Baron Alphons von Pawel-Rammingen. Her mother and brother Ernest
                                    objected, as Alphons was not royal. However, Queen Victoria supported her, as
                                    Frederica
                                    was also a member of the British Royal Family. Victoria gave Frederica away at a
                                    splendid wedding at Windsor Castle in April 1880. Afterwards Victoria gave Frederica
                                    apartments at Hampton Court. Frederica’s only child ,Victoria, was born in 1881,
                                    but died three weeks later. Frederica was interested in children and became patron
                                    of the Church Extension Association, then in Kilburn, which wished to set up
                                    schools in the new suburb of Willesden. On July 24th 1889, she formally opened
                                    our school. In 1898, she left Hampton Court and spent much time in Biarritz.
                                    She continued to attend state occasions in Britain until 1914. She also entertained
                                    members of the Royal Family staying in Biarritz. When she died in 1926, her body
                                    was brought back to Windsor Castle and buried in St George Chapel near her father
                                    and daughter and other members of the Royal Family.</p>

                                <p>Malcolm was a tower of strength at Governing body meetings. His contributions were
                                    wise & all benefitted from his long experience. The community is the poorer for his
                                    loss. My thoughts are with Caroline & his family.

                                <p>To the Winterburn Family, My thoughts go out to you all at this most difficult time.
                                    Malcolm was a truly wonderful person.... he will be missed by many...but he will
                                    live on through his wonderful family and the memories we all have of him.
                                    <em>Lots of Love Steve Baptiste</em></p>
                                <p> I met Malcolm when I joined Princess Frederica’s board of governors as a Parent
                                    governor. In my time on the board I came to understand that Malcolm was a man of
                                    insight and integrity in all areas that being a school governor touched.</p>
                                <p> As a ‘new boy’ I was told that part of the job description of being a governor was
                                    to be a critical friend to the process. But what did that actually mean? Malcolm
                                    embodied everything that ‘critical friendship’ might involve. Keenly interested, and
                                    supportive of what was in the best interest of Fred’s, his experience and powers of
                                    analysis would always help guide the group to a position where we could evaluate the
                                    matter under consideration. Malcolm didn’t want to spend any longer on the subject
                                    than he felt was necessary, but nor did he want to move on until it had been fully
                                    explored. We all learnt from his presence, wisdom, and brisk efficiency.</p>
                                <p>Perhaps I didn’t know Malcolm as well as many others did. However I liked him better
                                    than my own experience might’ve suggested. Malcolm had an individual warmth, and it
                                    was pleasing to prompt a smile from him.</p>
                                <p>For everything that Malcolm did, for the way he lived his life, and for the example
                                    he set to all, it could be fairly said he defined the very meaning of being a
                                    ‘pillar of the community.’
                                    I’m grateful for having known Malcolm.

                                <p>Malcolm was the kindest of men. He was a wonderful friend and a bright shining light
                                    in our community. He was brave and wise and principled. His faith and devotion to
                                    God was inspiring and I feel truly privileged to have known him. I will miss him so
                                    very much. My thoughts and prayers are with Caroline, Phillipa, Sarah, Jonathan and
                                    all his family at this time. Thinking of you. Rest in peace.

                                <p>Malcolm was on the interview panel that appointed me as Head of Princess Frederica

                                    wisdom, objectivity, challenge and above all, his support.He was gentle but firm. In
                                    him I found an inspirational mentor of great integrity with an invaluable skills

                                <P>Malcolm's approach to everything was simple - don't pre-judge, understand the facts,
                                    consider alternatives, make a plan and drive towards a solution. But Malcolm never
                                    under-estimated the human interest and always ensured that people were supported at
                                    every level. I'm honoured to have benefited from Malcolm's wisdom and grace - what
                                    he's contributed to and done for Freds is inestimable. Our children and community
                                    are the true beneficiaries of Malcolm's wisdom. Rest in peace and know that your
                                    memory will be honoured at Freds forever. x
